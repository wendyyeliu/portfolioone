    <h4>


    Wendy Liu is an artist who works primarily in photography, drawing, and printmaking. She uses printmaking techniques to create large scale installations of immersive landscape and cityscape spaces. She applies a similar concept to her photography and drawings as well, taking apart visual aspects of her life that she is familiar with and then rebuilding them to create new spaces. Liu’s primary subject matter depicts the neighborhood she grew up in and the environment she currently resides in. Liu looks for meanings in the direction she takes as an artist by utilizing the juxtaposition of her past memories and the ones she presently makes.
